# Oliver Liam Kelly

**'Perpetually Learning'**

Picking up interests and skills is my hobby. I have and continue to work in many different industries and allowed myself to develop and grow in those roles wherever they took me. I strive to be solutions focused in my projects and strive for continuous improvement and optimisation of my solutions.

I love learning new technologies and expanding the tools available to me. Currently I am a Fullstack Developer looking for growth opportunities, I’m willing to collaborate on anything and everything. I enjoy a challenge and love the push of working with others and having dependencies. I am open to work on a flexible schedule as I am looking to resume my studies in Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Physics at the University of Sydney in 2024.

Please feel free to reach out to me via email at oliverliamkelly@gmail.com or on my various social medias.
